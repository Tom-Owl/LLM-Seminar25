      "Human: How do I make a honey baked ham at home for Christmas dinner?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: You can make honey baked ham by soaking a bone-in ham in a mixture of honey, brown sugar, garlic, and apple cider vinegar.  Make sure the bone side is completely covered in the mixture, then place the ham in a baking dish.  Drizzle with more honey, brown sugar, and vinegar mixture.  Bake for an hour at 325°F, or until cooked through.  \n",
      "You can also make a sweet glaze to pour over the ham during the final 15 minutes of cooking.  Start with 1/2 cup each of honey and brown sugar, add a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and some garlic and/or onion.  If\n",

      "Assistant: Try a mixture of chopped pineapple and cherries if you want something sweet and fruity.  The cherries should go on after baking for the final 15 minutes of cooking.\n",

      "Assistant: I don’t have a lot of specific suggestions for reducing your gum disease risk, but the primary cause of gum disease is bacterial plaque buildup on your teeth. So I recommend that you wash your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride-free toothpaste, use a mouthwash with anti-bacterial properties, and schedule regular dental visits to maintain good oral health.\n",

      "Human: Any other ideas?\n",
